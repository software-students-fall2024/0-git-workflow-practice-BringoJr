## My Comments

I found this article interesting because it outlines the struggles computer science graduates are having with finding entry level jobs. The tech industry is one of the  unique, as it can be done fully remotely, and thereore the lack of geographical restraints means people can be employed from anywhere. This means the pool of applicants is larger and therefore roles are more competetive. Also, many entry level jobs require around 4 years of previous experience, which seems paradoxical given the entry level of the position.
